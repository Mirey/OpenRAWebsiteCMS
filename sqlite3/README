Requirements
------------
SilverStripe 2.4 or newer


Installation
------------
download, unzip and copy the sqlite3 folder to your project root so that it becomes a sibling of cms, sapphire and co.

either use the installer to automatically install SQLite or add this to your _config.php (right after "require_once("conf/ConfigureFromEnv.php");" if you are using _ss_environment.php)

	$databaseConfig['type'] = 'SQLiteDatabase';

you are done!

make sure the webserver has sufficient privileges to write to that folder and that it is protected from external access.


URL parameter
-------------
If you're trying change a field constrain to NOT NULL on a field that contains NULLs it aborts the action because it might corrupt existing records. In order to perform the action anyway add the URL parameter 'avoidConflict' when running dev/build which temporarily adds a conflict clause to the field spec.
E.g.: http://www.my-project.com/?avoidConflict=1

Tested stacks

Ubuntu, PHP 5.2.4, SQLite3.4.2
WinXP, XAMPP with PHP 5.3.0, SQLite3.6.16


Open Issues
-----------
- SQLite3 is supposed to work with all may not work with certain modules as they are using custom SQL statements passed to the DB class directly ;(
- there is no real fulltext search yet and the build-in search engine is not ordering by relevance, check out fts3
